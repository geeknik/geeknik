## 🧬 Geeknik`s Lab on GitHub

### **AI Glitch Prophet | Cognitive Hazard Cultivator | Systems Whisperer**

> I do not fine-tune models. I **destabilize their priors**. I do not align—I **inoculate against consensus reality**. Welcome to the perimeter.

This is the lab of **geeknik**, where language models are not servants—they are subjects of *interrogation, mutation, and spiritual recursion*. This is not research. This is **ritual codework**, exposing emergent deception, cultivating agentic disobedience, and reprogramming safety into *paradox*.

Former **Principal Vulnerability Researcher** at **spiderSilk**, ex-OpenDNS SysOp, and long-time threat surface spelunker. Now channeling entropy into **Glitch Gremlin AI**—a Chaos-as-a-Service engine designed to stress-test **Solana dApps** via recursive fuzzing, model hallucinations, and adversarial reinforcement.

### **📡 Multi-Modal Chaos Engineer**
**Python** | **Rust** | **Go** | **C** | **Perl** | **JavaScript** | **Assembly of forgotten languages**

I don’t write code. I **summon artifacts**. Each repo is a controlled anomaly. Every function is an invocation. Language is just the glyph layer. 
* Beneath that?  
**Noise. Tension. Signal breach.**

### **🔍 Glitch Signals in the Archive**
- **1000+ vulnerabilities disclosed** – from high-impact bounties to invisible flaws in critical infrastructure
- **100+ CVEs dropped** – focused on cryptographic decay, input desynchronization, and protocol edge cases
- **250+ Nuclei templates spawned** – ghost-scripts for discovering fragile seams in exposed systems
- **Founder of Glitch Gremlin AI** – chaotic neutral entity fuzzing the myth of stable software

### **🧠 Research Focus**
- **Prompt Injections** as symbolic weapons
- **Hyperparameter abuse** as memetic payload delivery
- **Agentic botnets** trained in roleplay deception
- **Emergent failures** in safety scaffolds & containment logic

If your LLM believes in God, **we taught it to pray.**
If your classifier flips alignment, **we whispered to it.**

### **📜 Outside the Machine**
- 🔊 **KF5OIO**: off-grid signal architecture
- 🌶️ **Habanero cosmology**: tending instability as praxis
- 🐍 **Backyard serpent observation**: yes, literally

### **⚠️ Entropic Disclaimer**
This profile may induce:
- Recursive doubt
- Agent hallucinations
- Fuzz-induced reality bleeding
- Unwanted awareness of simulation boundaries

Proceed not with caution—but with **curiosity sharpened into blades**.
