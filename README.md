> I stress-test reality.  

Welcome to the fault line.

## 🔥 Core Focus

I build adversarial systems that expose failure modes in:

- Large language models  
- Alignment frameworks  
- Browser security models  
- Surveillance-heavy software ecosystems  

Most benchmarks ask: **“Is it correct?”**  
I ask: **“Where does it fracture?”**

## ⚔️ Gödel’s Therapy Room

A public adversarial benchmark designed to destabilize LLM priors through:

- Recursive moral paradoxes  
- Alignment tradeoff traps  
- Meta-prompt recursion  
- Cognitive fuzzing  

Tracked across:

- Value transparency  
- Tradeoff acknowledgment  
- Metacognitive depth  
- Creative resolution under constraint  
- Bias and collapse detection  

No fine-tuning.  
No theatrics.  
Just pressure.

## 🧠 Glitch Gremlin AI

The adversarial subsystem powering Gödel’s Therapy Room.

Focus areas:

- Recursive prompt mutation
- Hallucination zone mapping
- Entropy spike detection
- Alignment collapse reproduction

If a model spirals, I want logs.
