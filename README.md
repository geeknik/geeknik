## 🌀 Geeknik's Lab on GitHub  

### **Reality Hacker | Entropy Architect | Cybernetic Shaman**  

In the vast expanse of cyberspace, a consciousness known as **geeknik** oscillates between states—**vulnerability researcher, open-source engineer, chaos orchestrator.** I **fuzz the matrix, collapse potential exploits, and extract knowledge from entropy.**  

Former **Principal Vulnerability Researcher** at **spiderSilk** | Former OpenDNS SysOp | Bug Bounty Hunter | OSS contributor

Currently architecting **Glitch Gremlin AI**, a **Chaos-as-a-Service** platform designed to stress-test **Solana dApps** through **AI-driven fuzzing and entropy modeling**.  

### **🛠 Code Polyglot & Reality Forker**  
**Python** | **Perl** | **Rust** | **Ruby** | **Go** | **JavaScript** | **C** | **C++**  

Each **commit is a reality shift**, every repository a **recursive dive into structured chaos.** My cognitive architecture is a **fractal network of languages**, each a **tunnel into the computational multiverse.**  

### **🧠 Key Contributions & Research**  
- **🔍 100+ security vulnerabilities disclosed** (Tesla, Comcast, Dell, Naspers, etc.)  
- **🔬 18+ CVEs uncovered** (Fuzzing **tcpdump, Mozilla NSS, OpenSSL**, and more)  
- **🔧 250+ Nuclei templates** created, enhancing **automated attack surface discovery**  
- **📜 Open-source contributions:** ProjectDiscovery, security tooling, AI-driven automation  
- **🌌 Founder of Glitch Gremlin AI** – Quantum chaos testing for Web3 security  

### **🚀 Current Quest**  
Exploring the **probabilistic intersections** of **security research, adversarial AI, and open-source independence.** If there’s a weakness in the system, it will be found—**before someone else finds it first.**  

### **🌐 When Not Collapsing Wave Functions...**  
- 📡 **Surfing reality waves** as **KF5OIO** (amateur radio, off-grid comms)  
- 🌱 **Growing parallel worlds** in my garden (chili peppers & chaos theory)  
- 🎯 **Hunting & fishing** (reality debugging in meatspace)  
- 🍃 **Tending Schrödinger's Eden** (a greenhouse of quantum potential)  

### **⚠️ Engage at Your Own Risk**  
Interacting with this entity may induce **spontaneous cognitive bifurcations, heightened infosec paranoia, and an irreversible awareness of digital entropy.**
